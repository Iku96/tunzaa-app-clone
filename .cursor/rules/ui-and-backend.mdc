# UI and Backend in Harmony

**Context:** Read **AGENTS.md** for full project instructions, past issues, and lessons learned. Update AGENTS.md when the user gives new instructions or when you fix something important.

When implementing or changing **any UI** (screens, forms, buttons, flows), **implement the backend** (API, persistence, state) at the same time so the feature works end-to-end.

## Do

- **New screen or flow** → Add or update API calls, Supabase queries, or local persistence so the screen reads/writes real data.
- **New form or action** → Wire submit handlers to backend (e.g. Supabase, REST), handle loading/error states, and reflect success in UI.
- **New user preference or setting** → Persist it (e.g. AsyncStorage, Supabase `profiles` or settings table) and read it on app load.
- **List or detail view** → Fetch from backend; don’t leave placeholder or mock data as the final implementation.

## Don’t

- Don’t ship UI that only uses local state or TODOs without a backend path.
- Don’t add “TODO: connect to API” as the only follow-up; implement the integration in the same change set where possible.

## Scope

- **Backend** here means: any persistence or server interaction (Supabase, REST, GraphQL, AsyncStorage, SecureStore, etc.).
- If the project has no server yet, “backend” can be local persistence and clear types/hooks so that swapping in a real API later is straightforward.
